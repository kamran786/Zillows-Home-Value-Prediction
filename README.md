# Zillows-Home-Value-Prediction

In this competition, Zillow asked us to predict the log-error between their Zestimate and the actual sale price, given all the features of a home. The log error is defined as: logerror=log(Zestimate)âˆ’log(SalePrice) As part of this project, we predicted the logerror for the months in Fall 2016. To get the best result that we got we performed Data Visualization, Data Quality, EDA, various Machine Learning Algorithms implementation, Hyperparameter tuning etc.

The notebook covers following topics:

1. Missing Value Analysis
2. Correlation Analysis
3. Top Contributing Features (Through XGBoost)
4. Correlation Analysis
5. Multicollinearity Analysis
6. Univariate Analysis
7. Bivariate Analysis
8. Missing value filling using KNN algorithm
9. Supervised Learning algorithms to predict "logerror"
10. Hyperparameter Tunning
11.Additional features
